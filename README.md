### About
Burger is a web application designed to virtually create and eat burgers. 

### Current Deployment
The user can create a burger by typing the name into the "Place Order!" field. Once the add button is clicked the new burger will display under "Pick order up!" in a list. The user can then eat the burger by clicking the corresponding eat button. The burger will then display under "Eat the burger!". This application was created with an MVC structure, with content stored in a MySQL database.

### Future Deployment
Additional updates to the application may include a button to move burgers from the "Eat the burger!" area to "Pick order up!"
